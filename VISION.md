# ClawTriage Vision 
 
ClawTriage is a self-hosted GitHub Action for OSS maintainers managing high-velocity PR queues. It provides semantic deduplication, quality scoring, and vision alignment - giving maintainers signal without noise. PRs should be small, focused, conventional-commit formatted, and aligned with the project roadmap.
